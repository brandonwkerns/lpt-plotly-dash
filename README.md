# Realtime display of Large Scale 

The LPT data update once a day on crontab. Real-time tracking is for the 90 days ending with *yesterday*.

A time-longitude plot of rainfall and LPT system (LPTs) centroid is on the left, and on the right a map plot of LPT system centroid. It can be selected whether all LPTs are displayed, or just MJO LPTs. Both of these plots are interactive, using Plotly Dash.

Further interactivity is provided by the time range drop-down menu, which shows the recent 90-day tracking results as well as the previous years' annual tracking results.
